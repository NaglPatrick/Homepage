        Abstract: Real-time databases deal with time-constrained data and time-constrained transactions. The design of
        this kind of databases requires the introduction of new concepts to support both data structures and the dynamic
        behaviour of the database. In this paper, we give an overview about different aspects of real-time databases and we
        clarify requirements of their modelling. Then, we present a framework for real-time database design and describe
        its fundamental operations. A case study demonstrates the validity of the structural model and illustrates SQL
        queries and Java code generated from the classes of the model.
        Keywords: Real-time database,Real-time objects, Object-relational model, UML Profile, UML CASE Tools.</p>

        🧠 Full Script

        🔹 Intro [~30 seconds]

        Hi, I’m [Your Name], and today I’m excited to share highlights from my paper, A Framework to Model Real-Time Databases.
        This work is all about real-time data management—the kind that powers air traffic control, financial trading, and even autonomous vehicles.

        When data goes stale, lives or money can be at risk. So how do we model databases that keep up with time-sensitive applications?

        🔹 The Problem [~1 minute]

        Traditional databases are great at storing structured data, but not so great at handling dynamic database behavior.
        In real-time systems, data must be accurate and timely—meaning it needs to reflect the current state of the world now, not a few seconds ago.

        Unfortunately, standard modeling tools like UML don’t account for things like data aging, sensor updates, or method deadlines.
        That’s where my framework comes in.

        🔹 The Framework [~2 minutes]

        I developed a UML-based extension called UML-RTDB to model real-time systems.
        It introduces new concepts—like "Sensor" and "Periodic" stereotypes—to model the flow of time-sensitive data.

            We designed custom data types like RTInteger and RTReal, which track not just values, but when they were last updated.
            And we modeled methods by how they behave in time: periodic (for regular updates), sporadic (for computations), and aperiodic (for on-demand operations).

            In other words, we made the modeling tools smarter about time.

            🔹 Implementation & Case Study [~1.5 minutes]

            This wasn’t just theory—we implemented it.

            Using software modeling tools, specifically an open-source platform called Fujaba, we extended the environment to support our UML profile.
            We added icons, stereotypes, and validation logic, then tested everything with a case study validation in the domain of air traffic control.

            From the model, we generated both SQL queries and Java code, showing the framework works from design to deployment.

            🔹 Why This Matters [~1 minute]

            If you’re building time-sensitive applications, this kind of modeling is essential.
            Real-time systems are no longer niche—they’re everywhere.
            We need frameworks that bring timing, concurrency, and correctness into the early design phase, not after the fact.

            🔹 Closing [~30 seconds]
