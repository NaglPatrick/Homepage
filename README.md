# Homepage

This is a website I made for myself in order to practice Html, css and javascript.
I hope I can use it in the future to practice some new expertiese I aquire.
Also, this website does not run on any server and is for my educational purpose only.

## @Todo page

Here I tried with javascript to make a adaptive list of "things I have to do". Its supposed to create todo´s in order and be able to delete them again with rearranging the order of the remaining todo´s.
